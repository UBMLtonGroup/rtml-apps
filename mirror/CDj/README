Real-time Collision Detector Benchmark
--------------------------------------

Quick start: "ant"

The results presented in the paper submitted to JTRES were measured using
COL and NOI workload.  The configuration used can be found in scripts
run_rts_col.sh and run_rts_noi.sh.  In particular, the binary dump of the
air traffic used is in input/col.bin and input/noi.bin.

Almost all of the code is licensed under the New BSD License (see
license.txt). The exceptions are:

  * utils/javacp ...  this is code copied from GNU Classpath licensed under
                      GPL ; you can get rid of GPL by removing this directory
                      and replacing "javacp.util" by "java.util" in all
                      source files

  * simulator/command/java_cup  

		      this is a copy of the Java CUP distribution
                      (version0.10k) we used for creating a parser in the CD
                      simulator ; the code of java_cup is not needed unless
                      you wanted to change the parser ; Java CUP is
                      distributed under its own license which is compatible
                      with GPL

		      the exact license text for Java CUP 0.10k can be found
		      in the LICENSE file in
                      http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/java_cup_v10k.tar.gz
                      it is also pasted below in this file

  * simulator/command/parser
		      parser generated by Java CUP

  * simulator/command/scanner
	              generated lexer code
